## Development Process

### Setting Up Development Environment

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wordpress-swarm.git`
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes thoroughly
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add some feature"`
7. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`
8. Submit a pull request

### Testing

All pull requests must include appropriate tests:

1. Unit tests for individual components
2. Integration tests for service interactions
3. End-to-end tests for complete workflows

Run tests locally before submitting a pull request:

```bash
./run_tests.sh
```

### Code Review Process

The core team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks, we may close the PR if it isn't showing any activity.

## Style Guides

### Git Commit Messages

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line
- Consider starting the commit message with an applicable emoji:
    * üé® `:art:` when improving the format/structure of the code
    * üêé `:racehorse:` when improving performance
    * üîí `:lock:` when dealing with security
    * üìù `:memo:` when writing docs
    * üêõ `:bug:` when fixing a bug
    * üî• `:fire:` when removing code or files
    * üíö `:green_heart:` when fixing the CI build
    * ‚úÖ `:white_check_mark:` when adding tests
    * üîñ `:bookmark:` when releasing / version tags
    * üöÄ `:rocket:` when deploying stuff

### Docker Style Guide

- Follow the [Docker best practices](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)
- Use specific version tags for base images, not `latest`
- Minimize the number of layers
- Group related commands in the same RUN instruction
- Remove unnecessary files after installation
- Use multi-stage builds when appropriate

### Documentation Style Guide

- Use [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) for documentation
- Reference Docker commands and configuration options with code blocks
- Include examples for all configuration options
- Document all environment variables and their default values
- Provide troubleshooting guides for common issues
